<p> Firms that built their reputations by trading credit-default swaps,
    such as BlueMountain Capital Management and Saba Capital Management,
    are struggling to find profitable ways to invest money in the CDS market.
    Traders at investment banks and hedge funds are abandoning the field for better opportunities.
    “It did feel like the situation was a bit of a dead end,” says Dmitry Selemir, who left his job
    trading structured credit at BlueMountain in June to concentrate on Scriggler.com, a website he co-founded
    to host essays and discussions of ideas. “I found it increasingly difficult to be excited about what
    I was doing.”</p>
